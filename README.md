# modified-hotel-reservation-spring-app
School project with a modified hotel reservation website

Modified a Spring application with a Java back end and an Angular front end to include multithreaded language translation, a message at different time zones, and currency exchange. Then, built a Docker image of the current multithreaded Spring application and containerized it.

node_modules are missing from UI folder, so program does not run
